				"   connections. Again, any color will do; however, avoid "
				"   using anything that might accidentally cross-connect "
				"   with other segments. "
				""
				"5. At the end of this Green Covered Cable, place another "
				"   ME P2P Tunnel. This should place with the flat side "
				"   facing out, giving a nice view of the Certus texture on "
				"   that face. "
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"6. Next, these two Tunnels must be linked; this is "
				"   performed with a Memory Card; the color of the card "
				"   does not matter."
				""
				"7. Sneak Right-Click the Card on the ME P2P Tunnel "
				"   attached to the Controller. The frequency will change "
				"   from 0000 to some random four-character ID. "
				"   That ID is now stored in the Memory Card. "
				""
				"10. Now, take the Memory Card to the other P2P Tunnel "
				"    and Right-Click the Tunnel. It should now be "
				"    configured on the same Frequency ID and should "
				"    display as “Linked (Output Side)”. Place a Yellow "
				"    Dense Cable against the flat side of this Tunnel and "
				"    all 32 channels from the Controller will now be "
				"    accessible to the Yellow Dense Cable. "
				""
				"At this point, the Green Covered Cable should show that only one channel has been used, no matter how many connections are made on the Yellow cable. "
				""
				"With such a small network, this may seem like a lot of work for little gain, and that would be an accurate assessment. However, consider a larger Controller multiblock: "
				""
				"● Eight P2P Tunnels can be placed against the Controller "
				"  and connected via a single Controller line as above."
				" "
				"● A single Covered Cable can then transmit all eight of "

				"  total of 256 channels, all being transmitted over a "
				"  single Covered Cable."
				" "
